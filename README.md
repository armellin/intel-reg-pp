# Overview
This tool was created while working on a Thermal Throttling problem associated with Intel® Core™ i5-4300U Processor (formerly Haswell).  Since looking at data sheets required checking specific registers and bits it became useful to draw these in a formate that mimicked the data sheet.  For example, the image below is shown in a datasheet titled "Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume  3B: System Programming Guide, Part 2".
